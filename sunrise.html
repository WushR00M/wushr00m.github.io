            <h2>Welcome to Solaris!</h2>
            <p>
            	Sunrise is a 2D platformer / top down, featuring the ability to create and share levels you make to the world. On a mysterious day in the land of Solaris, the mayor who has been missing for 4 weeks, returns with the intent of violence, sending shockwaves across the world with a magic device, powerful enough to wipe anything from existance. With this newfound power, he shoots it up at the most important thing, the device powering the artificial sun. Now, with all light gone across the world, it's up to you to retrieve the pieces of the device, put them together, and stop the mayor before there's nothing left...

            <h3>Platforms and Content Warnings</h3>
              <p>
                Sunrise is not exactly a horror game. While it has upbeat, fun cartoonish looks, sometimes horror images can display itself at different scenes in the Story Mode cutscenes. Sunrise also has depicted blood, although being replaced with oil because... robots? Yeah. Sunrise also has lots of flashing lights, however, these can be toggled. As of currently, Sunrise is ONLY on Windows. However, a Linux version is to come very soon and a Mac version coming in the long run. Android is getting worked on for support, but as WushR00M says: "touch controls are really hard to program". Take her word for it.
