            <h2>Welcome to Solaris!</h2>
            <p>
            	Sunrise is a 2D platformer / top down, featuring the ability to create and share levels you make to the world. On a mysterious day in the land of Solaris, the mayor who has been missing for 4 weeks, returns with the intent of violence, sending shockwaves across the world with a magic device, powerful enough to wipe anything from existance. With this newfound power, he shoots it up at the most important thing, the device powering the artificial sun. Now, with all light gone across the world, it's up to you to retrieve the pieces of the device, put them together, and stop the mayor before there's nothing left...

            <h3>Platforms and Content Warnings</h3>
              <p>
                Sunrise is not exactly a horror game. While it has upbeat, fun cartoonish looks, sometimes horror images can display itself at different scenes in the Story Mode cutscenes. Sunrise also has depicted blood, although being replaced with oil because... robots? Yeah. Sunrise also has lots of flashing lights, however, these can be toggled. As of currently, Sunrise is ONLY on Windows. However, a Linux version is to come very soon and a Mac version coming in the long run. Android is getting worked on for support, but as WushR00M says: "touch controls are really hard to program". Take her word for it.

				<h2>4 Years of Sunrise</h2>
				<p>
					Ever since the idea and concept of Sunrise was pitched to me by UndergroundError back in 2021, I've been
					committed to making the best game I possibly can, even with my ups and downs. Ever since, Sunrise has gone
					through many different phases, including the "GameMaker 8.1" phase from 2021-2023, before we transitioned
					development onto the latest LTS version of GameMaker where we continue to commit today. The development
					team has been growing ever since, combined with oppurtunities such as a Google Play release, cameos and
					awesome collaborations, Sunrise has been a project near and dear to me.
				</p>
				<p>
					For all of that, I want to say thank you for supporting Sunrise throughout the years, even if you're a new
					player or someone who's been there since the beginning, truly, you've helped make this project special. For
					now, I want to talk a bit of what the future holds for Sunrise...
				</p>
				<h2>What is Codename Laser?</h2>
				<p>
					Codename Laser is to be the next major release of Sunrise, Alpha v0.3.0. So far, this update has already taken
					various months, and we are even then still nowhere close to halfway finished with this update. This next
					update sports tons of new content, features, and more that we need our time to work on, so please stay patient
					(or snoop for teasers on our GitHub repo).
				</p>
				<h2>A Google Play Release?</h2>
				<p>
					Sunrise is currently being developed to run on Android devices, to eventually release on the Google Play Store!
					This release will coinside with v0.3, being released as a minor update, v0.3.5. The download will be
					completely free alongside an external source release, where Sunrise's APK download will be available on the
					itch.io page. We're working very hard and our beta-testers are snooping through everything, so be patient for
					this as well!
				</p>
				<h2>Funding Sunrise + Switch (2) Support</h2>
				<p>
					These topic is a little on the edge at the moment. The thing about funding this game is, we wouldn't have a big
					enough audience to fully fund this game on a place like Kickstarter, where we can set up stretch goals and more,
					which is why, when it comes to this, we're planning it for the future, but are holding off for now. Another thing
					to mention is that we're in the midst of working on a much smaller scale side project for Sunrise, where the
					game would eventually get its release for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 devices, completely for free, and
					the latter including various exclusive features such as mouse support, gamechat, and more. The base version (and
					the Switch 2 version) is also set to include split-screen multiplayer, connecting with your Nintendo Switch Online
					friends, etc. We've had this in the books for around a year now, but we're going to continue to hold this one off
					until late stage development (beta / full-release).
				</p>
				<h2>Thank You</h2>
				<p>
					Once again, I want to say thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for continuing to support Dash and his friends in
					Sunrise, and I hope you enjoy playing Codename Laser when it releases.
				</p>
